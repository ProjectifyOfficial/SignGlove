# SignGlove 

## About

In the context of ECESCON 9 Hackathon, we have developed as a team a low-cost gesture glove for interpretation of sign language. This glove enables hearing impaired users to capture sign language notices (at a prominent stage with the requirements of the competition) through a cross-platform mobile and computer application that allows them to be recognized, recorded and spoken, translate nods into spoken text, facilitating their communication with other people.

## Team

The team comprises of
1. Michalis Meggisoglou
